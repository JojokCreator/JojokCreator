<h2>“I am an Aspiring Full Stack Web Developer”</h2>

After spending the most of my life in hospitality and resort management. I am currently looking to change my career path towards using my passion and knowledge in website design and coding.

I have completed studying CS50 online and have just completed the School of Code a 16-week boot camp where I learnt how to work in a high-performance tech team using agile working methods and user-driven design to create UI/UX. 

I have built several REST API’s linked to databases and front-ends in React which fetched data from those services. We focused on testing and modern software engineering practices using jest, cypress and react-testing. I am proficient in git which I have been using to track different versions of my code and collaborate with other developers.
